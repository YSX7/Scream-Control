## Contributing

The code most likely contains a bunch of errors, is written crookedly and at its writing probably antipatterns are applied. But open to learning, so you can help in any way, whether it's code editing or just advice.

## Acknowledgments

The project was created for itself, first of all with the purpose to shut up the restless brother at least a little bit. Along the way, it became interesting to study WCF, correctly use WPF with MVVM, and not just through events, and to deal with Github.
